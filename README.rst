configs.openbsd
===============

It's simple.  Just my configurations that I use for my server running OpenBSD.

See https://github.com/katt64/configs for my main workstation's configuration from which configurations here are derived.
Do keep in mind that my server runs OpenBSD (a BSD) yet my workstation runs Gentoo (a Linux distro), so the nature of the configs may turn out to be *fundamentally different*!
